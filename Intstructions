I assume no responsibility if anything happens
 to your phone.
You and only you are responsible if anything
 goes wrong.

Prerequisites:
Unlocked bootloader.
Custom ROM.
Recovery installed.
Flashed latest magisk.
Patience.

Process:
1. Create a backup of boot image and of dtbo too if possible.
2. Flash magisk if you haven't.
3. Flash kernel zip.
4. Reboot

Note: If your phone goes to splash screen and 
keeps looping, press all 3 buttons till phone
boots into bootloader, reboot to recovery, flash
kernel zip again, wipe cache and dalvik and
reboot to system. In case the phone gets stuck
at boot animation, follow the same procedure.
